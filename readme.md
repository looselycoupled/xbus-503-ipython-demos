# Overview

This project contains demonstration code for the XBUS-503 Data Wrangling course at Georgetown University CCPE.  All code makes use of [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) which allows one to interactively run Python code within a web browser.

## BeautifulSoup

This notebook demonstrates the ease with which one can use [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to efficiently navigate and parse HTML.  

## Pandas

This notebook (originally authored by Abhijit Dasgupta) demonstrates the use of [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to quickly analyze the [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) database.
